If over half the ""N"" atoms can be accumulated in this state, this will exceed the population of the ground state ""N"". A population inversion (""N"" > ""N"" ) has thus been achieved between level 1 and 2, and optical amplification at the frequency ν can be obtained.

Simply, V-type atoms have 3 states: formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7. The energy levels of formula_5 and formula_6 are higher than that of formula_7. When electrons in states formula_5 and :formula_6 subsequently decay to state formula_7, two kinds of emission are radiated. In formula_1-type atoms, there are also 3 states: formula_5, formula_6, and :formula_7.

The two most commonly encountered synthetic routes are through the reaction of indole with oxalyl chloride followed by reaction with dimethylamine and reduction of the carbonyl functionalities with lithium aluminum hydride to form DMT. The second commonly encountered route is through the n,n-dimethylation of tryptamine using formaldehyde followed by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Sodium borohydride is not used as it reduces the formaldehyde to methanol before it is able to react with","this reaction, methylmagnesium bromide is reacted with isophorone with and without 1 mole percent of added copper(I) chloride (see figure). Without added salt the main products are alcohol B (42%) from nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group and diene C (48%) as its dehydration reaction product. With added salt the main product is 1,4-adduct A (82%) with some C (7%). A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of","1,1-dimethyldiborane, and trimethyldiborane. Other products are hydrogen gas and lead metal. Other methods to form methyldiboranes include treating hydrogen with trimethylborane between 80 and 200 °C under pressure, or treating a metal borohydride with trimethylborane in the presence of hydrogen chloride, aluminium chloride or boron trichloride. If the borohydride is sodium borohydride, then methane is a side product. If the metal is lithium, then no methane is produced. dimethylchloroborane and methyldichloroborane are also produced as gaseous products. When CpZr(CH) reacts with diborane, a borohydro group inserts into the zirconium-carbon bond,and methyl diboranes are produced. In ether dimethylcalcium reacts with diborane"
2,"particle can be expressed as a linear combination of just two eigenstates, or eigenspinors. These are traditionally labeled spin up and spin down. Because of this, the quantum-mechanical spin operators can be represented as simple 2 × 2 matrices. These matrices are called the Pauli matrices. Creation and annihilation operators can be constructed for spin- objects; these obey the same commutation relations as other angular momentum operators. One consequence of the generalized uncertainty principle is that the spin projection operators (which measure the spin along a given direction like ""x"", ""y"", or ""z"") cannot be measured simultaneously. Physically, this means","in formula_5 and σ takes on 2""s""+1 values, where ""s"" is the half-integral intrinsic spin of the fermion. For electrons ""s"" = 1/2 and σ can have two values (""spin-up"": 1/2 and ""spin-down"": −1/2). It is assumed that the positions of the coordinates in the notation for Ψ have a well-defined meaning. For instance, the 2-fermion function Ψ(1,2) will in general be not the same as Ψ(2,1). This implies that in general formula_6 and therefore we can define meaningfully a ""transposition operator"" formula_7 that interchanges the coordinates of particle ""i"" and ""j"". In general this operator will not be equal","""s"" (and = 0). Spin operators have the ladder operators: which raise or lower the spin magnetic quantum number ""m"" by one unit. Spherical bases have broad applications in pure and applied mathematics and physical sciences where spherical geometries occur. The transition amplitude is proportional to matrix elements of the dipole operator between the initial and final states. We use an electrostatic, spinless model for the atom and we consider the transition from the initial energy level E to final level E. These levels are degenerate, since the energy does not depend on the magnetic quantum number m or m′."
3,"summation convention. The generalized Maxwell's equations possess a certain symmetry, called a ""duality transformation"". One can choose any real angle , and simultaneously change the fields and charges everywhere in the universe as follows (in Gaussian units): where the primed quantities are the charges and fields before the transformation, and the unprimed quantities are after the transformation. The fields and charges after this transformation still obey the same Maxwell's equations. The matrix is a two-dimensional rotation matrix. Because of the duality transformation, one cannot uniquely decide whether a particle has an electric charge, a magnetic charge, or both, just by","other. If like poles are facing each other though, they are repulsed from the larger magnetic field. The Gilbert model almost predicts a correct mathematical form for this force and is easier to understand qualitatively. For if a magnet is placed in a uniform magnetic field then both poles will feel the same magnetic force but in opposite directions, since they have opposite magnetic charge. But, when a magnet is placed in the non-uniform field, such as that due to another magnet, the pole experiencing the large magnetic field will experience the large force and there will be a net","regroup and explain the somehow dynamic but non-relativistic quasistatic approximations of Maxwell's equations. In 1905 Einstein made use of the non-Galilean character of Maxwell's equations to develop his theory of special relativity. The special property embedded in Maxwell's equations is known as the Lorentz invariance. In Maxwell's equations frame, assuming that the speed of moving charges is small compared to the speed of light, it is possible to derive approximations that fulfill Galilean invariance. This approach enables the rigorous definition of two main mutually exclusive limits known as quasi-electrostatics (electrostatics with displacement currents or ohmic currents) and quasi-magnetostatics (magnetostatics with"

The following elementary result is a key step in the analysis. Suppose that formula_23 is an eigenvector for formula_12 with eigenvalue formula_25, that is, that formula_26. Then In other words, formula_28 is either the zero vector or an eigenvector for formula_12 with eigenvalue formula_30 and formula_31 is either zero or an eigenvector for formula_12 with eigenvalue formula_33. Thus, the operator formula_10 acts as a raising operator, increasing the weight by 2, while formula_11 acts as","this point using formula_52. Form the reduced density matrix formula_53 for the first two block system, the block and the left-site. By definition it is the formula_54 matrix: formula_55 Diagonalize formula_53 and form the formula_57 matrix formula_58, which rows are the formula_59 eigenvectors associated with the formula_59 largest eigenvalues formula_61 of formula_53. So formula_58 is formed by the most significant eigenstates of the reduced density matrix. You choose formula_59 looking to the parameter formula_65: formula_66. Form the formula_54 matrix representation of operators for the system composite of the block and left-site, and for the system composite of right-site and universe-block,","some operator formula_12 onto x, formula_13. First, the algorithm represents the vector formula_8 as a quantum state of the form: Next, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator formula_16 to formula_17 for a superposition of different times formula_18. The ability to decompose formula_17 into the eigenbasis of formula_7 and to find the corresponding eigenvalues formula_21 is facilitated by the use of quantum phase estimation. The state of the system after this decomposition is approximately: where formula_23 is the eigenvector basis of formula_7, and formula_25. We would then like to perform the linear map taking formula_26 to formula_27,"
5,"double counting: where ""r"" is the position of the ""i""th atom, and ""V"" is the potential energy between two atoms. It is difficult to solve this many-body problem explicitly in either classical or quantum mechanics. In order to simplify the task, two important approximations are usually imposed. First, the sum is only performed over neighboring atoms. Although the electric forces in real solids extend to infinity, this approximation is still valid because the fields produced by distant atoms are effectively screened. Secondly, the potentials ""V"" are treated as harmonic potentials. This is permissible as long as the atoms remain close","time. Take one of those nine space dimensions and make it a circle of radius R, so that traveling in that direction for a distance L = 2πR takes you around the circle and brings you back to where you started. A particle traveling around this circle will have a quantized momentum around the circle, because its momentum is linked to its wavelength (see Wave-particle duality), and 2πR must be a multiple of that. In fact, the particle momentum around the circle - and the contribution to its energy - is of the form n/R (in standard units, for an","physics. This can be heuristically understood as a relation to the relevant length scales in the problem: formula_21 is the length of the potential and this identifies a momentum scale for this problem as, setting formula_60, formula_61. In mass weighted scales, we identify an energy scale as formula_62 and form a dimensionless quantity using the height of the potential and the energy scale formula_62 as formula_64. Reintroducing formula_33 and formula_34, we discover: formula_67, which is precisely our shape parameter formula_20. Using formula_20, the reflection coefficient becomes: For formula_71, one finds formula_72 ≅ formula_73 ∝ formula_74. The power of formula_75 is"

The CMB photons are scattered by free charges such as electrons that are not bound in atoms. In an ionized universe, such charged particles have been liberated from neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the universe that they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main","of the universe. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is light that was emitted after recombination that is only now reaching our telescopes. Therefore, looking at, for example, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, one is basically looking back in time to see an image of the universe when it was only 379,000 years old. WMAP indicates (Figure 1) a smooth, homogeneous universe with density anisotropies of 10 parts per million. However, There are large structures and density fluctuations in the present universe. Galaxies, for instance, are a million times more dense than the universe's mean density. The current belief","path of the photons formula_3 was approximately equal to the horizon size of the universe formula_4.

These were identified as gibberellin biosynthesis genes or cellular signaling component genes. Stem growth in the mutant background is significantly reduced leading to the dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. HYVs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform HYVs.","survival and proliferation can be thought of as “disease-susceptibility genes.” Recessive resistance genes are disease-susceptibility candidates.

Similarly, the Barley ""MLO"" gene and spontaneously mutated pea and tomato ""MLO"" orthologs also confer powdery mildew resistance.

Being a fully benzenoid PAH means that triphenylene is much more resonance stable than its isomers chrysene, benz[""a""]anthracene, benzo[""c""]phenanthrene, and tetracene.

18,"Michael reaction The Michael reaction or Michael addition is the nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. It belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions. This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C–C bonds. Many asymmetric variants exist. In this scheme the R and R' substituents on the nucleophile (a Michael donor) are electron-withdrawing groups such as acyl and cyano making the methylene hydrogen acidic forming the carbanion on reaction with base ""B:"". The substituent on the activated alkene, also called a Michael acceptor, is usually a",of an acetate group by the phenolic group to a diorganolead intermediate which in some related reactions can be isolated. The second step is then akin to a Claisen rearrangement except that the reaction depends on the electrophilicity (hence the ortho preference) of the phenol. The nucleophile can also be the carbanion of a β-dicarbonyl compound: The carbanion forms by proton abstraction of the acidic α-proton by pyridine (now serving a double role) akin to the Knoevenagel condensation. This intermediate displaces an acetate ligand to a diorganolead compound and again these intermediates can be isolated with suitable reactants as unstable,"Multiple Michael/aldol reaction Multiple Michael/aldol reaction (or domino Michael/aldol reaction) is a consecutive series of reactions composed of either Michael addition reactions or aldol reactions. More than two steps of reaction are usually involved. This reaction has been used for synthesis of large macrocyclic or polycyclic ring structures. Gary Posner and co-workers were the first to report using multiple Michael/aldol reactions to construct macrolide structures. Their method utilized a Michael-Michael-Michael-ring closure (MIMI-MIRC) or a Michael-Michael-aldol-ring closure annulation sequences to assemble acrylates and/or aldehydes together to form substituted 9-, 10-, and 11-membered macrolide structures.

19,"formula_9 from the equation above, we get only half the measured value. The discrepancy is explained by our model not being accurate: nucleons in fact interact with each other, and are not spread evenly across the nucleus. For example, in the shell model, a proton and a neutron with overlapping wavefunctions will have a greater strong interaction between them and stronger binding energy. This makes it energetically favourable (i.e. having lower energy) for protons and neutrons to have the same quantum numbers (other than isospin), and thus increase the energy cost of asymmetry between them. One can also understand the","First a Hamiltonian for the nucleus is defined. Usually, for computational practicality, only one- and two-body terms are taken into account in this definition. The interaction is an effective theory: it contains free parameters which have to be fitted with experimental data. The next step consists in defining a basis of single-particle states, i.e. a set of wavefunctions describing all possible nucleon states. Most of the time, this basis is obtained via a Hartree–Fock computation. With this set of one-particle states, Slater determinants are built, that is, wavefunctions for ""Z"" proton variables or ""N"" neutron variables, which are antisymmetrized products","pions, as opposed to quarks and gluons as in QCD. The effective theory contains parameters called low-energy constants, which can be determined from scattering data. Chiral EFT implies the existence of many-body forces, most notably the three-nucleon interaction which is known to be an essential ingredient in the nuclear many-body problem. After arriving at a Hamiltonian formula_1 (based on chiral EFT or other models) one must solve the Schrödinger equation where formula_3 is the many-body wavefunction of the ""A"" nucleons in the nucleus. Various ab initio methods have been devised to numerically find solutions to this equation: Ab initio methods"
20,"Structural isomer Structural isomerism, or constitutional isomerism (per IUPAC), is a form of isomerism in which molecules with the same molecular formula have different bonding patterns and atomic organization, as opposed to stereoisomerism, in which molecular bonds are always in the same order and only spatial arrangement differs. There are multiple synonyms for constitutional isomers. Three categories of constitutional isomers are skeletal, positional, and functional isomers. Positional isomers are also called regioisomers. In chain isomerism, or skeletal isomerism, components of the (usually carbon) skeleton are distinctly re-ordered to create different structures. Pentane exists as three isomers: ""n""-pentane (often called simply","Isomer An isomer (; from Greek ἰσομερής, isomerès; isos = ""equal"", méros = ""part"") of a molecule has the same number of atoms of each element, but has a different arrangement of the atoms. It has the same molecular formula as the other molecule, but with a different chemical structure. Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties, unless they also have the same functional groups.

21,"the electrons is called the ""oxidizing agent"", or ""oxidant"". Thus, the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common oxidizing agent, but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen. For reactions involving oxygen, the gain of oxygen implies the oxidation","octadecamolybdophosphoric acid (). One unexpected oxygen compound is dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate, , discovered in studying the properties of platinum hexafluoride (). A change in color when this compound was exposed to atmospheric air suggested that dioxygen was being oxidized (in turn the difficulty of oxidizing oxygen led to the hypothesis that xenon might be oxidized by , resulting in discovery of the first xenon compound xenon hexafluoroplatinate ). The cations of oxygen are formed only in the presence of stronger oxidants than oxygen, which limits them to the action of fluorine and certain fluorine compounds. Simple oxygen fluorides are known. Among","oxygen generation from carbon dioxide, CO diffuses through the porous electrode (cathode) and reaches the vicinity of the electrode-electrolyte boundary. Through a combination of thermal dissociation and electrocatalysis, an oxygen atom is liberated from the molecule and picks up two electrons from the cathode to become an oxide ion (O). Via oxygen ion vacancies in the crystal lattice of the electrolyte, the oxygen ion is transported to the electrolyte-anode interface due to the applied DC potential. At this interface the oxygen ion transfers its charge to the anode, combines with another oxygen atom to form oxygen (O), and diffuses out"

When a small, unhindered base – such as sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, or sodium ethoxide – is used for an E2 elimination, the Zaitsev product is typically favored over the least substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann Product. For example, treating 2-bromo-2-methylbutane with sodium ethoxide in ethanol produces the Zaitsev product with moderate selectivity.

An example, published in 1924, illustrates the reaction in a substituted benzoyl chloride system: Perhaps surprisingly, α-bromoacetophenone is the minor product when this reaction is carried out with benzoyl bromide, a dimeric dioxane being the major product.

The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes: Related reactions are also used as quantitative measures of unsaturation, expressed as the bromine number and iodine number of a compound or mixture. Hydrohalogenation is the addition of hydrogen halides such as HCl or HI to alkenes to yield the corresponding haloalkanes: If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with fewer hydrogen substituents.

When heated in contact with glass, silicon tetrafluoride gas is produced along with the metal. Platinum tetrafluoride can form adducts with selenium tetrafluoride and bromine trifluoride. Volatile crystalline adducts are also formed in combination with BF, PF, BCl, and PCl. The fluoroplatinates are salts containing the PtF ion. Fluoroplatinic acid"
24,"reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers. In a substitution reaction, a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group. These reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic, electrophilic or radical substitution. In the first type, a nucleophile, an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge, replaces another atom or part of the ""substrate"" molecule. The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the leaving group departs with an electron pair.","Name reaction A name reaction is a chemical reaction named after its discoverers or developers. Among the tens of thousands of organic reactions that are known, hundreds of such reactions are well-known enough to be named after people. Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of","Atherton–Todd reaction The Atherton-Todd reaction is a name reaction in organic chemistry, which goes back to the British chemists F. R. Atherton, H. T. Openshaw and A. R. Todd. These described the reaction for the first time in 1945 as a method of converting dialkyl phosphites into dialkyl chlorophosphates. The diacyl chlorophosphates formed are often too reactive to be isolated, though. For this reason, the synthesis of phosphates or phosphoramidates can follow the Atherton-Todd reaction in the presence of alcohols or amines.

Complete ""endo"" selectivity is observed for this process as a result of templating by the metal. Although notable work on [6+4] cycloadditions was reported by Rigby et al. in the late 1980s, the study of metal-complexed dienes with tropones received comparatively little attention. In 2006, Welker and co-workers reported that their cobaloxime dienes react with unsubstituted tropones through exo","orbital overlap with the LUMO of the diene. Common classes of dieneophiles for DA reaction include vinyl ethers and vinyl acetals, imine, enamines, alkynes and highly strained olefins.

In this example of a multi-component reaction both formaldehyde (1) and isopropylaldehyde (8) are converted into dithianes 3 and 9 with 1,3-propanedithiol. Sulfide 3 is first silylated by reaction with ""tert""-butyllithium and then trimethylsilyl chloride 4 and then the second acyl proton is removed and reacted with optically active (−)-epichlorohydrin 6 replacing chlorine.

The reducing agent DIBAL-H (Diisobutylaluminium hydride) is often used for this purpose: though it normally reduces all carbonyls, it can stop reducing at the aldehyde if only one equivalent is used at low temperatures. LiAl(OtBu) (formed from LiAlH and tBuOH in situ) can also stop reducing at the aldehyde, through a similar mechanism to DIBAL-H. The traditional method of forming aldehydes without reducing to alcohols - by using hindered hydrides and reactive carbonyls - is limited by its narrow substrate scope and great dependence on reaction conditions. One workaround to avoid this method","carbocation, forming the product. Additionally, because 2-chlorobutane is antiperiplanar, it can undergo E2 elimination reactions with strong bases. In it, the chlorine leaving group is removed, and the double bond is restored to yield different constitutional isomers2.

Some studies of the C NMR in particular favored interpretation via the protonated nortricyclene structure. In addition, Raman spectra of the 2-norbornyl cation in some acidic solvents show an absorption band at 3110 cm indicative of an electron-depleted cyclopropane ring. Since that absorption band would be expected in the C-symmetric protonated nortricyclene, some scientists claimed this as convincing evidence for this interpretation.

For example, Cp′Fe(PPh)(CO)I has four different signals in the H-NMR spectrum for the ring hydrogens and five different signals in the C-NMR spectrum for the ring carbons. There is therefore no symmetry within the ring even accounting for rotation around the ring–metal axis, but instead there is a diastereotopic relationship as a result of being part of a chiral complex. The achiral precursor complex Cp'Fe(CO)I has only two signals for those hydrogens and three for those carbons, indicating a symmetric structure.

In the tetravalent species, the lack of the silicon's empty 3p orbital breaks the π ring, causing an upfield shift as the deshielding due to aromatic ring current is lost.

Approximately 9,000,000 kilograms were produced worldwide in 1989. It has also been prepared by dehydrogenation of 3-methylpiperidine, derived from hydrogenation of 2-methylglutaronitrile. 3-Picoline is a useful precursor to agrochemicals, such as chlorpyrifos.

The synthesis is noteworthy because ordinary aniline derivatives are unreactive toward hydroxide. Because the triaminobenzene also exists as its imine tautomer, it is susceptible to hydrolysis. The compound behaves like a ketone in its reaction with hydroxylamine, forming the tris(oxime). But it behaves also like a benzenetriol (""K"" = 3.56 × 10, ""K"" 1.32×10), as the three hydroxyl groups can be methylated to give 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene.

This is seen as a variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000 K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600 K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong ""gravity darkening"" effect. As viewed from the","lot of starlight, it heats them, making thermal emissions potentially detectable. Since telescopes cannot resolve the planet from the star, they see only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small — the photometric precision required is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star – such Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days are detectable by space telescopes such as the Kepler Space Observatory.

Distillation and chromatography are only practical for the separation of mono- and dialkylated material when the molecular weight difference between the two is large.

The liquid drop model also allows the computation of fission barriers for nuclei, which determine the stability of a nucleus against spontaneous fission.

The benzimidazole is then alkylated with the desired 1-chloro-2-dialkylaminoethane, forming the final product. This particular procedure was most useful for the preparation of benzimidazoles that lacked substituents on the benzene rings. A diagram of this method is displayed below. The most versatile synthesis developed by the Swiss team first involved alkylation of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene with 1-amino-2-diethylaminoethane to form N-(β-Diethylaminoethyl)-2,4-dinitroaniline [aka: N'-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine].

The nitration of 1,2-dichlorobenzene mainly produces 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, together with smaller amounts of the 3-nitro isomer. It can also be prepared by chlorination of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene. One of the chlorides is reactive toward nucleophiles.

142,"Pinacol rearrangement The pinacol–pinacolone rearrangement is a method for converting a 1,2-diol to a carbonyl compound in organic chemistry. The 1,2-rearrangement takes place under acidic conditions. The name of the rearrangement reaction comes from the rearrangement of pinacol to pinacolone. This reaction was first described by Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig in 1860 of the famed Fittig reaction involving coupling of 2 aryl halides in presence of sodium metal in dry ethereal solution. In the course of this organic reaction, protonation of one of the –OH groups occurs and a carbocation is formed.

Most famously, at least in the classroom, pinacolone arises by the pinacol rearrangement, which occurs by protonation of pinacol (2,3-dimethylbutane-2,3-diol).

It also is generated by ketonization of pivalic acid and acetic acid or acetone over metal oxide catalysts. 3-Methylbutanal is a starting material for 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, which in turn is converted to pinacolone. Pinacolone can also be produced from 2-methy-2-butanol when reacted with C5 alcohols. Pinacolone is produced in large amounts for use","of this reaction is evident in the fact that even when a less stable isomer is formed, the reaction proceeds, demonstrating its high thermodynamic favorability. The general product of the reaction can potentially occur via two separate pathways: the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction, or an aza-Prins cyclization/pinacol rearrangement. These mechanisms have different stereochemical properties, which elucidate the dominance of the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction. The aza-Cope/Mannich reaction forces each atom in the [1,5] diene analog to undergo sp hybridization, erasing the starting material's stereochemistry at the labelled R' position, while the aza-Prins/pinacol rearrangement retains stereochemistry at the labelled R' position, pointing to a simple"

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a promising mechanism, which could be used to give mass to the vector gauge particles. A significant difficulty which one encounters, however, is Goldstone's theorem, which states that in any quantum field theory which has a spontaneously broken symmetry there must occur a zero-mass particle. So the problem arises—how can one break a symmetry and at the same time not introduce unwanted zero-mass particles. The resolution of this dilemma lies in the observation that in the case of gauge theories,","instanton and TS is intrinsically broken within instantons. Even though TS breaking within instantons is not exactly the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry by a global ground state, this effective TS breaking must also result in a scale-free behavior.
